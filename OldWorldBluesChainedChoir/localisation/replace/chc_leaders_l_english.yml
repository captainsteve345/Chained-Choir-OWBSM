FIRST_CHORISTER_DESC:0 "Born into a hell of experiments and twisted science, §RThe First Chorister§! was the daughter of an indebted, deluded and drugged-up mother and an unknown father. She wasn't first forged in that hell: she was the eleventh attempt - each before her had been experimented on with strains of FEV by scientists deep below the Watonga Correctional Compound; in an attempt to induce psychic powers. She fell victim to their experimentation too, but became the first to survive - and the first songstress of the new machine. She was but the first of many, however: after her, more than two dozen Choristers joined her - chained to horrendous machines in a room they knew as The Chapel. Before the bombs fell, the scientists' machines kept the Choristers from singing in unison, but after the scientists abandoned The Chapel to escape the nuclear holocaust, and their once perfectly maintained machines decayed, the Choir could finally sing in harmony. And all the Wasteland will hear their song."
